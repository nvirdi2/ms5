Reflection

Overall my experience in this class was okay! I would say I pick up topics very slow 
and that would become that was difficult because I would have to start early and manage other
course work at the same time. However, I would say that the workload and me just being slow 
at understanding topics was the most difficult part of this entire class but the concept that
was being taught by the professor was easy to look back and play over and over again. There
were many times where on the workshops and homework I had looked back on to lecture or
even the website examples. That made it a little easier for me to grasp the concepts. The way the
quizzes weekly was an overall great experience because it kept the concepts refreshed and I was able
to look back at the quiz and see what I got wrong and reflect on how to fix that. With all the resources
and information provided the course was overall great. I learned many new concepts, which include 
destructor to prevent memory leaks, reference of the current object, allocate and deallocate, and much 
more. However, I still do believe I could practice more and work on deallocate and realizing in my code 
that theres gonna be a memory leak or to check before deallocating and everything else.
